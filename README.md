# Fraud Report Automation
## Overview
This project was created to learn Selenium using Python. Thinking of a real life scenario where I could use Selenium, the first thing that came to mind was an automation to fill out CA EDD fraud report forms. Quick background story, a few years ago I was involved in a car accident that left me with 45% body burns and amputated fingers. The person responsible for the accident injured 10 people, including myself. Us victims were receiving restitution, but out of nowhere we stoped receiving any. I later discovered that many people, who are charged restitution, look for jobs that pay 'under the table' to avoid payments. I believe it is morally wrong to avoid restitution payments for a crime one commits, so I decided to create an automation to report this fraud. :)
