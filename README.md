# Selenium
This project was created to help me learn Selenium in Python.

## Background
Thinking of a real life scenario where I would apply Selenium, the first thing that came to mind was an automation to fill out CA EDD fraud report forms. Quick background story, a few years ago I was involved in a car accident that left me with 45% body burns and amputated fingers. The person responsible for the accident injured 10 people, including myself. Us victims were receiving restitution, but out of nowhere we stoped receiving any. I later found out that many people paying restitution look for jobs that pay 'under the table' so that they can avoid making payments. It is morally wrong to avoid paying restitution to people you injured, so I thought I would report this with minimal effort by creating a fun automation that would submit fraud reports for me. :)
