# Fraud Report Automation
## Overview
This project was created to help me learn Selenium using Python. Thinking of a real life scenario where I could apply Selenium, the first thing that came to mind was an automation to fill out CA EDD fraud report forms. Quick background story, a few years ago I was involved in a car accident that left me with 45% body burns and amputated fingers. The person responsible for the accident injured 10 people, including myself. Us victims were receiving restitution, but out of nowhere we stoped receiving any. I later found out that many people paying restitution look for jobs that pay 'under the table' to avoid making payments. I believe it is morally wrong to avoid restitution payments for a crime one commits. Therefore, I decided to report this fraud on a monthly basis, until restitution payments continued, by creating an automation that would submit fraud reports for me. :)
